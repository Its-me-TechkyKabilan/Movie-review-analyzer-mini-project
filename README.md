## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie_sentiment_project.git
cd movie_sentiment_project

2. Install Requirements
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py

🧠 Model Training (sentiment_training_and_saving.py)
Loads nltk.corpus.movie_reviews

Converts text to TF-IDF vectors

Splits data into training/testing sets

Trains a logistic regression classifier

Saves the model & vectorizer using pickle

🎯 Streamlit App (app.py)
Takes user input (movie review text)

Preprocesses using the saved vectorizer

Predicts sentiment using saved model

Displays the prediction: ✅ Positive / ❌ Negative
